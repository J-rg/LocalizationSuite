            <h2>Creating the Localizer files</h2>

            
            <p>Now that you have added the resources to be localized and defined the languages, you are ready to create the Localizer files for the translators. The actual localization of the strings will take place in the Localizer module of the Localization Suite. Please refer to the <a href="help:anchor=lc_start bookID=LC Help">Localizer Help</a> for further information on working with the Localizer.<br><br>
            
<img src="../gfx/localizer.png"><br><br>

First of all you need to set the location of the Localizer files. By default, the Localization Manager will create the Localizer files in the project folder of the Localization Manager. If you want the Localizer files to be saved in a different folder, click <font class="ui">Set Location...</font> at the bottom of the Localization Manager window and set the folder for the Localizer files to be saved.<br><br>

<b>Embedding Dictionaries into the Localizer file</b><br>

You might have Localization Dictionaries of previous localizations which might be helpful for your translators when working on a new project. Such dictionaries might include localizations of previous software builds or general menu terminology to be used. Please refer to the <a href="help:anchor=ld_start bookID=Localization Dictionary Help">Localization Dictionary Help</a> for further details on how to create, import and export Dictionaries.<br><br>

Once you have created a Dictionary with the Localization Dictionary, you can embed this dictionary into the Localizer files by clicking <font class="ui">Window > Show Dictionaries...</font><br><br>

<img src="../gfx/dict_settings.png"><br><br>

The Dictionary window will open. Click <font class="ui">+</font> and browse for the dictionary you want to add to the Localizer file. Select the desired dictionary file and click <font class="ui">Open</font>. The selected dictionary will now appear in the <font class="ui">Dictionary list</font> and will automatically be included in the Localizer file.<br><br></p>

<div id="contentframe">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>
Alternatively you can open the Dictionary window by clicking Options... in the Localization file section of the Localization Manager window.</p>
</div><br><br>
<p>
<b>Creating one Localizer file for each language</b><br>

If you use multiple translators localizing into one language each, you should create a Localizer file for each individual language. To do so, mark the option <font class="ui">Selected languages in separate files</font> and mark the languages you want to be exported into individual Localizer files. To create the Localizer files click <font class="ui">Write Out</font> in the Localizer file section of the Localization Manager window.<br><br>
</p>
<div id="contentframe">
<p><b>Note:</b><br>
If you want this setting to be applied to all languages, simply deselect all languges in the language list. This will set the Selection in the Localization Manager window to <font class="ui">All languages</font>.</p>
</div><br><br>

<p>In case you use one or more translators that will localize your application into more than one language each, see Creating Localizer files below with multiple languages.<br><br>

<b>Creating Localizer files with multiple languages</b><br>

Are you employing a translator that can localize your resources into multiple languages? Instead of providing multiple Localizer files, one for each language, you can also create one Localizer with multiple languages. Simply mark the languages to be included in the Localizer file in the Languages list of the Localization Manager window, mark the option <font class="ui">Selected languages in one file</font> and click <font class="ui">Write Out</font>. The Localization Manager will create one Localizer file containing the selected languages.<br><br></p>

<div id="contentframe">
<p><b>Useful hint:</b><br>
If you want this setting to be applied to all languages, simply deselect all languges in the language list. This will set the Selection in the Localization Manager window to <font class="ui">All languages</font>.<br><br>

You can combine Localizer files with one language only and multiple languages. See Creating one Localizer file for each language for information on how to create Localizer files containing one single language.</p></div>
